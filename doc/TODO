Still to document:

# Requirements
  virtualbox -> 

  kvm -> ruby-libvirt gem
    v0.8.3 or higher
  require libvirt 0.8+ version 
    have a default dir pool installed
    permissions to write create new volumes

  vmfusion -> VMWare fusion installed
    Tested on VMWare fusion 0.3.x

# Changes to Definitions

  Virtualbox options ioapic, pae are now moved to :virtualbox => { vm_options => [ :ioapic => 'on' ]}
    now you can pass all options you have to virtualbox

# Use as a library

# ostype_id (not everytime exists on all providers)

# Rakefile contains check iso
# Rakefile contains test
# Rakefile contains real_test

# Templates
  idea is to split postinstall.sh to multiple pieces
  check for .veewee_version or .vmfusion_version to see for which provider we are building this
  include/exclude can do this
  default user becomes veewee, vagrant.sh will create the vagrant user if used under vagrant 
  uploading vmware.iso
  uploading virtualbox.iso

# Validation
  veewee.feature (depending on virtualbox, vagrant)
  no more ssh_steps
  uses @tags per provider

# veewee vmfusion export ova
# vagrant basebox export box

# New options
  --postinstall-include/exclude
  --auto (download yes)
  --force also for export
  --debug (debug output)

  ostypes are now synchronized accross kvm

Todo:
  veewee steps (username,password, + VEEWEE env variables)
  validate vms - + features selection
  check libvirt version
  windows test
  validation of checks (also - include/exclude)
  check execs with exit code
  multinetwork card 
  dkms for kernel installs
