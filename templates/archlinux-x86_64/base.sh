# Previously dhcpcd.service was enabled. However, in my testing it repeatedly
# failed to connect to the network on reboot. Enable dhcpcd@.service has worked
# in my case. My guess is that this is due to the line
# After=sys-subsystem-net-devices-%i.device
# in the service file.
# Restarting dhcpcd.service after boot or using Network Manager instead of
# dhcpcd also works
# Maybe a related bug report?
