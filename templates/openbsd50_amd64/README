The boxes come with:
- ports system already installed
- puppet and chef
- check the postinstall.sh script to see what is built in the box on top of the default install
- add/remove to your heart's content

a. Easy to use boxes for experimentation
- with puppet
- with chef
- with whatever else you can dream of :)

b. Mount
# freebsd mouting NFS patch for FreeBSD
# https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/commit/8a0a1bddb5afc6b99cab595d6f3cc9a95bb1a509
# OpenBSD will need patching to use it as NFS host
From the validation steps just the mount step fails
Virtualbox mount can be achieved using NFS mounts, it is not possible using the VBox tools since you can't compile them on OpenBSD
1. you can have your host expose NFS mounts that can be mounted by the Openbsd guest (checkout the vagrant documentation on using NFS mounts)
2. another way can be to work with vagrant in Puppet-server / chef-server mode since it will get manifests over the network from the puppet/chef server.
3. use a shell provisioner and scp/rsync your manifests from the host to the guest


c. Wait times
I've commented in all the steps in the OpenBSD install (definitions.rb)
Adjust the <Wait> times if your machine is slower/faster than those times.
